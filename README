What is it?
===========

A simple UDP based voice chat program.  Currently
we have support for libspeex and libsamplerate.
There will also be dtls support soon.

Why?
====

We basically need something that works well on
many UNIX flavours.  Skype is not really the answer
to that.  We also want something simple so that
we can build on top of it.

The plan is to create another program called
ssvideo for video streaming.

How to use it
=============

Pick one of the scripts already available and just
pipe them over to sscall.

For e.g. on OpenBSD:

./obsd/obsd-rec.sh | sscall 192.168.1.2 1234 4321

This will stream your voice to machine 192.168.1.2
on port 1234.  Similarly on the other side you can
connect on port 4321 on the local machine.

Note that if you use anything else other than 8000kHz
input sample rate, then you need to run sscall with the
appropriate arguments so that it can downsample the
stream.
