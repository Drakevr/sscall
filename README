What is it?
===========

A simple UDP based voice chat program.  Currently
we use libspeexdsp for its resampling capabilities
and opus as the audio codec.  There will also be ssl
support in future versions.

Why?
====

We basically need something that works well on
many UNIX flavours.  Skype is not really the answer
to that.  We also want something simple so that
we can build on top of it.

The plan is to create another program called
ssvideo for video streaming.

How to build
============

Simply `make' followed by a `make install'.  If you
are building with an unusual configuration please
check the Makefile and the comments for what to do.

How to use it
=============

Pick one of the scripts already available and just
pipe them over to sscall.

For e.g. on OpenBSD:

./obsd/obsd-rec.sh | sscall 192.168.1.2 1234 4321

This will stream your voice to machine 192.168.1.2
on port 1234.  Similarly on the other side you can
connect on port 4321 on the local machine.

Note that if you use anything else other than an 16kHz
input sample rate, then you need to run sscall with the
appropriate arguments so that it can downsample the
stream.

Similarly on the receive path if you use anything else
other than 16kHz, then sscall will upsample to that sample
rate.

These options are generally useful if your system does
not support certain input/output sample rates.

Supported systems
=================

- Linux
- OpenBSD
- FreeBSD
- Solaris

* It possibly works on other UNIX systems as well, we just
have not had a chance to test yet.
