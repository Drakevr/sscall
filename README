What is it?
===========

A simple UDP based voice chat program.

How to use it
=============

Pick one of the scripts already available and just
pipe them over to sscall.

For e.g. on OpenBSD:

./obsd/obsd-rec.sh | sscall 192.168.1.2 1234 4321

This will stream your voice to machine 192.168.1.2
on port 1234.  Similarly on the other side you can
connect on port 4321 on the local machine.
